Data format
===========

What is the data format expected by qserv?

- How to go from the stack output format to the qserv intput format?

  - Catalogs are stored in fits files
  - How to access the schema?
  - How to create csv files from these fits files? Is there a way to
    do that already implemented in the stack? Check on community or
    start a discussion about that if needed

- Start the test with one or two catalogs, and a small part of the sky
- Write a script to take care of that automatically. It should be able to
  load any catalog
- See the qserv_testdata `repository
  <https://github.com/lsst/qserv_testdata>`_
